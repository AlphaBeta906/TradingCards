# TradingCards

I work on this when I can, but I do have life events such as work and girlfriend problems!

## Goals
I have a few goals for this personal project.
* Create a Trading Card game! (Think collectible cards like Baseball or Football cards)
* Actually FINISH a python project and be satisfied with it.
* Look at forks from my friends over at /r/learnpython to see what they are up to and how I can learn from what they do
* Learn how to better use github revision control for my future career

## Files
These are the files and what they do

### Trading Card Game Structure.txt
This was just a quick idea I came up with at work while it was slow, but it gave me something to base my code on.

### TradingCards.py
This is the main file. This has all the classes (Card, Pack, Theme) and important code in it.

### edit.py and create.py
Holds the functions that let you edit\create packs\themes

### tests.py
This holds the tests for testing that all the stuff works correctly

### TCGui.py
This is the testing GUI. As of now, it doesn't really work... :'( I'll get there one day.

### pyrand.py
This is the random number and string generator that I created so I didn't have to import any libraries like numpy.random or stdlib.random. It works as expected.

### _server
This file contains things that I'll be using for my server.

### ThreadedTCPServer.py
My threaded TCP server that will handle the connections from clients.

### pyhash.py
My pure python MD5, and a pure python SHA384 (https://github.com/sfstpala/SlowSHA/blob/master/slowsha.py)
