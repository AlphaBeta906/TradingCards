# TradingCards

## Goals
I have a few goals for this personal project.
* Create a Trading Card game! (Think collectible cards like Baseball or Football cards)
* Actually FINISH a python project and be satisfied with it.
* Look at forks from my friends over at /r/learnpython to see what they are up to and how I can learn from what they do
* Learn how to better use github revision control for my future career

## Files
These are the files and what they do
### Trading Card Game Structure.txt
This was just a quick idea I came up with at work while it was slow, but it gave me something to base my code on.
### TradingCards.py
This is the main file. This has all the classes (Card, Pack, Theme) and important code in it.

I'll probably be splitting this baby up in the future

### tests.py
This holds the tests for testing that all the stuff works correctly
