Functions of each part of the game.

Card: It's a card. It's the main value of the game. That's about it.

Pack: Buy a pack and open it, obtaining x amount of cards, with chances to get different rarity-levels of cards. Themed packs can have an arbitrary max of themed cards.

Theme: Limited time design to a card, wether it be time-limited or amount-limited. Theme cards will almost always be more rare than basic cards.
