will change storage system so each user has a folder and various things are contained within (card collection, gold amount, password hash, etc)
- info such as activation, passhash and email hash will be stored in info.usr
- cards and currency etc will be stored in inventory.inv
- possible future options will be stored in options.opt

back from break heres what i decided about file system and other possible future things
- activation stuff (activation status and activation code) will be stored in activation.usr
- other information (email hash, password hash, any future important info) stored in info.usr
- cards currency and other inventory related things will be stored in inventory.inv
- options like gui vs cli mode will be stored in options.opt. Options are stored here for ease of access.
--- Another thing to note: Users will be able to select local storage or server storage for options.

want to change it from 1 handler per socket to more than 1 handler per socket before I start doing menu things.
- Thinking maybe 10 sockets per handler will be good, will raise the max number of connections by 10.
- Once I make myself a proper testing script, I will confirm if it needs to be more or less.
